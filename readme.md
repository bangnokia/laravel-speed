# Laravel speedster

Make your client's website runs "ultra lightning fast" on production by time if he did not pay.

This is just a funny stuff inspired by [https://github.com/kleampa/not-paid](https://github.com/kleampa/not-paid).

## Usage

```bash
composer require bangnokia/laravel-speed
```

## Configuration

You can set due date at `config/app.php` (optional)

Example
```php
'due_date' => '2021-05-12',
```

## Testing

You should test on the client's production site.
